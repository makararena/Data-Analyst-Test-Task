I was invited to analyze a test task for a **Junior Data Analyst** role. To demonstrate my capabilities in presenting, data visualization, machine learning basics aiding in data analysis, and core data analytics skills, I decided to showcase the completed analysis on my GitHub page. Unfortunately, despite my efforts, it appears that the test task has not been reviewed.

### Contents:

1. **Data:** This folder contains all the data utilized in my assignment.
2. **Solution.ipynb:** This notebook serves as the primary analysis file.
3. **Plots:** Here, you'll find a collection of all plots in `.png` format.
4. **paper.pdf:** The final paper presentation of the project, compiled in PDF format.

Feel free to explore the analysis and reach out with any feedback or inquiries.
